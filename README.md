## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<li>A good solution to tackle this problem would be to implement a mobile application with the merits of AI,Computer Vision,API support,Native language support,etc. Firstly the application should be accessible to farmers at the ground level which is feasible thanks to the widespread use of smartphones or at least one smartphone per household. The app should use computer vision to analyse the farmers land, and must prompt him to fill a questionnaire that could be done either through text or even through voice where NLP should be implemented. Now this data must be fed into an AI/ML powered recommendation engine, which suggests the right crops taking into consideration:-

1)Soil type.
2)Tariffs on certain crops.
3)Resources available to the farmer.
4)Weather patterns in the particular area(API).
5)Market trends. 

Once this suggestion is finalised it is advisable for an expert to review the suggestion since the recommendation engine could be wrong but this intervention is not required in the long-run since the engine trains itself and gives better suggestions down the line; but I strongly believe at the genesis human intervention is crucial to gain trust from the farmers and to train the model as well.

Now once the crop is planted, the app can further help by:-
1)providing recommendations on pesticides by analysing images of the field.
2)Predicting drought, heavy rainfall, or pest outbreaks.
3)Sending proactive alerts.
4)Once the crop is harvested, directing them to the right buyer and the right time to sell with reference to the market(Though the market cannot be predicted and is uncertain; a good baseline could be provided).
5)If necessary the app could allow farmers to pool transport to bring the crops to the seller together reducing the transport cost,thus increasing their margin from the sale.
6)Crop History - The AI engine also checks what crops were previously grown in the same land. This helps recommend crop rotation for better soil health and yield.

## Technical Approach

 1.Farmer → Mobile App (Entry Point)
The farmer uses a mobile app/chatbot that supports voice, text, and image input in the local language.
This makes the app accessible even for low-literate farmers.



2. Data Collection
Survey (Questionnaire): Farmer fills details through text or voice (with NLP).
Computer Vision: Farmer uploads field/soil/crop/seeds images for AI analysis.
Crop History: The system records and remembers what crops were grown previously in the same plot of land.
3. AI/ML Recommendation Engine
This is the decision-making core. It combines:
Soil Type – what the land is best suited for.
Tariffs & Policies – govt subsidies/restrictions.
Resources Available – water, machinery, labor, etc.
Weather Patterns – via API integration.
Market Trends – price and demand forecasts.
Crop History – ensures proper crop rotation for soil health.
Farmer Inputs and preferences – from the app questionnaire and images.
4. Expert Review (Initial Phase)
Initially, an agriculture expert reviews AI’s recommendation.
This builds trust with farmers and improves AI by correcting early mistakes.
Later, as AI learns from feedback, this step becomes optional.
5. Post-Planting Support
Once the crop is planted, the app provides:
Pest/Disease Detection: Farmers upload leaf/crop images :- AI suggests remedies.
Weather & Risk Prediction: Forecasts drought, floods, or pest outbreaks.
Proactive Alerts: Sends SMS/voice alerts in regional language.
Market Guidance: Advises when & where to sell for best profit.
Pooling Transport: Farmers in a village or neighbouring villages can share transport to reduce costs & increase margins.
6. Feedback & Continuous Learning
Farmers give feedback i.e was the recommendation useful/not useful, how could they improve the interface and recommendation system,etc..
Feedback goes into the AI engine, refining predictions season by season.
Crop experts and NGOs can also validate advice.

## Feasibility and Viability
<ul><li>The idea is technically feasible but at a large scale there are certain problems to overcome.
1)Illiteracy among farmers could pose a huge challenge to the implementation of the project though the voice chat option makes it easier.; There are still hurdles to overcome in this domain.
2)While farmers have relatively widespread access to smartphones the same cannot be said for a stable internet connection which is crucial especially when sharing images and such. This could be solved to a degree by providing free internet at a specified public space for this particular operation- such as providing free wifi at the panchayat office. If the demand proves to be big enough the services would automatically start to establish infrastructure in the villages to serve their customers, thus the free wifi is only a temporary fixation.
3)Another big issue would be having region specific AI models. If one universal model is used throughout India, the recommendation may not be catered to the specific region, say for example the AI trained on fields of Tamilnadu would give drastically differing suggestions as opposed to the one trained on fields of Rajasthan.
4)There is still a very big caste and hierarchy stigma in the rural zones of India, which would impede the farmers from working together, for example in the case of pooling transport together.
5)There could be false positives especially when dealing with weather, this could decrease the trust of farmers on the tool. But this is a necessary evil because a hundred false positives is better than one false negative.
6)Farmers in some regions may resist crop rotation, preferring to grow traditional crops (e.g., rice in Tamil Nadu, wheat in Punjab).
7)Peer pressure and herd mentality can override app suggestions.
8)Building and maintaining AI + Computer Vision + APIs + expert review is resource-intensive. Scaling across states with different crops, soils, and languages needs heavy investment and government/NGO support. One solution to this problem would be to charge a small fee from the farmers once they are used to the app and start trusting it say post 5-10 years.
